##### Introduction | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/description/)

This problem asks us to determine if a linked list is a palindrome. What makes this problem a little challenging is the nature of linked lists where you can only traverse forward. There are multiple ways of solving this problem such as through arrays, stacks, or recursion, but I will be going through the two pointer solution.

##### Verifying Palindromes

Normally with a list / array, we can just check the 1st value and the nth value sequentially until we determine whether or not the given list / array is a palindrome. In terms of a linked list, this would be looping through two linked lists. With both linked list representing the 1st and 2nd half of the linked list.

The next question is how do we extract the 2nd half of a linked list? We need to first obtain a pointer that points to the middle of a linked list. A brute force method of doing this would be :

1. Loop until the end of the linked list to count the length
2. Loop again until we are at the n/2 node of the linked list

The brute force method works fine, however there is a two pointer method as well.

1. Initialize two pointers p1 and p2
2. p1 will move at a pace of 1, whereas p2 will move at a pace of 2
3. Once p2 reaches the end of the linked list, p1 will be at the middle of the linked list

There is one more problem. When p2 reaches the end, p1 will be at the middle of the linked list. We can't use p1 since we want to be able to look through the 2nd half of the linked list from the end. Therefore we will need to reverse the 2nd half of the linked list using p1.

##### Solution

Let's now apply the context to an actual solution.

1. Initialize two pointers `slowPointer` and `fastPointer`
2. Loop through the linked list with `slowPointer` incrementing by 1 and `fastPointer` incrementing by 2
3. Reverse the 2nd half of the linked list with `slowPointer`
4. Iteratively compare the 1st half of the linked list and the reversed 2nd half of the linked list to determine if the given linked list is a palindrome

##### Implementing the Solution

Let's first get the 2nd half of the linked list

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slowPointer = head
        fastPointer = head

        while fastPointer and fastPointer.next:
            # slowPointer moves by 1
            slowPointer = slowPointer.next
            # fastPointer moves by 2
            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next
```

Now that `slowPointer` points to the middle of the linked list, we now need to reverse it.

To reverse a linked list, we need to first initialize 3 variables : `current`, `prev`, and `nextCurrent`. `Current` equals to the start of the linked list, `prev` will be initialized as None, and `nextCurrent` will be the next value of `current`.

Now, let's make current's next value as `prev`.

Now, we need to make `prev` equal to current.

Lastly, we need to update `current` as `nextCurrent`. We also need to update the `nextCurrent` variable too.

We will repeat this process until current is null. By the end of the process, `prev` will point to our reversed linked list. Let's now implement a reverse function.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse_linked_list(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next_current = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_current
        return prev

    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slowPointer = head
        fastPointer = head

        while fastPointer and fastPointer.next:
            # slowPointer moves by 1
            slowPointer = slowPointer.next
            # fastPointer moves by 2
            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next
```

The reason we check if `fastPointer` and `fastPointer.next` exists is because we want to only run this loop if we can perform the operation `fastPointer.next.next` without any errors. Now that we hhave implemented the reverse function, let's use our function to reverse the 2nd half of the linked list.

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseLinkedList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next_current = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_current
        return prev

    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slowPointer = head
        fastPointer = head

        while fastPointer and fastPointer.next:
            slowPointer = slowPointer.next
            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next

        # We have reversed the 2nd half!
        reverseHalf = self.revrseLinkedList(slowPointer)
```

Now we just need to iteratively check if each corresponding value of the 1st and 2nd half are equal or not and we are done!

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseLinkedList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next_current = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = next_current
        return prev

    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        slowPointer = head
        fastPointer = head

        while fastPointer and fastPointer.next:
            slowPointer = slowPointer.next
            fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next

        reverseHalf = self.reverseLinkedList(slowPointer)

        while reverseHalf:
            if reverseHalf.val != head.val:
                return False
            reverseHalf = reverseHalf.next
            head = head.next

        return True

```
