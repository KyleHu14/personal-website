##### Introduction | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

This is a two pointer problem that asks us to find three numbers that sum to the target parameter given an array. I would suggest reviewing 2sum problems before attempting to solve this. I personally struggled with this problem quite a bit so take your time when trying to understand 3sum.

##### Intuition

Given a list, the problem asks us to return all unique triplets that sum to 0. This problem is quite similar to 2 sum but we need to make some adjustments to our algorithm. This explanation assumes that the reader understands the two pointer approach to 2 sum.

The first part of all nSum problems is to think how we can break it down to a n-1 sum problem. In our case we need to think of how to break down a 3 sum problem into a 2 sum problem. For example let's take a look at the following example case :

1. Say that we're looping through the nums array and our looping variable is called `firstIndex`
2. We can initialize two more variables called `secondIndex` and `thirdIndex`
3. `secondIndex` will be `firstIndex` + 1
4. `thirdIndex` will be the last index of the nums array
5. For each `firstIndex`, we will find all unique corresponding `secondIndex`s and `thirdIndex`s that together sums to 0

Notice that at #5 we are breaking the 3 sum problem into a 2 sum problem. Below is also psudocode that outlines the steps above. I have omitted the full implementation of #5 as I want to first give a general of the solution.

```python
numsLen = len(nums)
triplets = set()

for firstIndex in numsLen - 2:
    secondIndex = firstIndex + 1
    thirdIndex = numsLen - 1

    # Abstracted, we will implement this later
    allCombinations = findAllCombinations(firstIndex, secondIndex, thirdIndex)
    triplets.add( allCombinations )
```

##### Implementing the Solution

Let's start implementing our solution. Let's first initialize some base variables. We also need to sort the nums list before processing nums.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        triplets = set()
        numLen = len(nums)

        return triplets
```

Let's now bring the psudocode into our solution. Let's first initialize our for loop.

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        triplets = set()
        numLen = len(nums)

        for firstIndex in range(numLen - 2):
            secondIndex = firstIndex + 1
            thirdIndex = numsLen - 1

        return triplets
```
